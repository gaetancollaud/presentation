# Context

Sales analytics

Our customer has 1k+ shops with 300k+ products and do sales predictions every week.

They currently do analytics with excel...

Which is ... kinda slow ...

So they make aggregation (for instance they group all the milk related products)

---

# Apache druid

"Apache Druid is a high performance real-time analytics database."

Druid is composed of multiple services and each services has it's defined scope

SQL query language

Immutable data coming from different sources (makes copy)

Goal is to answer to any query (even multiple Terra Bytes) under one second

Joins possible, but limited and relatively slow. It's best to flatten the data

Index everything ! Each dimension has its own dictionary

Not that easy to setup...

# Under the hood

segmentation/partition => Same as kafka 

Time based but can also be split on a dimension.

"Perfect" segment is around 700mb

Rollout => "compact" the data

Time base eviction

Currently, join table are in memory (limitation)
